<p>Language: I'm most professionalized in Java and have strong knowledge of web development technologies like: Spring, Hibernate, Spring Data Jpa, BootStrap, etc.</p>

<p>Script: Familiar with Shell, Python.</p>

<p>Database: Well understanding of ralational database design. Although I only used Mysql in personal project. Before I joined XXX, I had 3 years experience and ofen dealt with Oracle stuff, like sql and procedure.</p>

<p>Message Middleware: Familiar with RabbitMQ, Kafka. They are ofen used to decouple MXN net mess to M+N when systems integrate. LinkedIn has its infrastructure built upon Kafka, while Indeed built upon the other.</p> 

<p>Big Data: Familiar with Zookeeper, Redis, Hbase. I used Redis as a reliable cache layer over application server tomcat. Also had a deeper understanding of Zookeeper when went through Kafka protocol design.</p>

<p>Serialization: Avro, Protobuf. Java built-in serialization/deserialization mechanism is not only verbose but also platform dependent, which makes it not a good choice for RPC. I doodled a runable demo months ago which can be found at:
https://github.com/henryceowzm/spring-redis-caching-with-protobuf</p>  

<p>Application Server: Stong undertanding and operational skill of Tomcat, not that much with Websphere.</p>

<p>Operating System: Skilled in Linux. At work, I used linux a lot. Even I switched my computer at home to Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Optimization: MAT, Jvisual, JOL, JMH. Most people had used the first two when troubleshooting. But the last two were these days mostly mentioned/used in open source projects, both were developed by a russian talent who works on OpenJdk. With the help of JOL, one can get a near pracise idea of the memory footprint. JMH is mainly used for performance testing/tuning, which works essentially by injecting code to source code when compiling, help eleminating pitfalls like False Sharing, Dead Code Elemination(DCE), etc.</p>

<p>Web Server: Familiar with Nginx, Lua. Nginx was used as a reverse proxy to Tomcat, also servered as static content provider. By leveraging Lua and X-Accel directive, it's easy to restrict resource access to Authenticated user.</p> 

<p>Virtualization: Experienced with Docker, but needs to be enhanced in the future.</p>

<p>Methodology: Clean Code, self-descriptive class and method, which is much more readable and mantainable, also shows better performance gain under hotspot jvm as which likes small methods. For me the best way is to find excellent small open source projects(like disruptor), try their examples, read source code and use them in project.</p>

<p>Text Search Engine: Elastic search and Lucene. Before I joined XXX, I used Lucene as text search engine in address searching, which would be used when placing broudband order at China Telcom service desktop.</p>

<p>wireless Smart Kettle Project
A self-driven project initiated by me and my friend
Self designed protocol(mostly variable-length based), so Netty is handy for this need
Primitive type backed map, as far as I know this feature will be ported into Jdk1.9</p>

<p>Endeavour to Technologies: High performance, architecture, virtualization and big data.</p>
